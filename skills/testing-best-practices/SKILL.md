## Universal rules

These apply regardless of language or framework.

- Use test factories for all test data in unit and integration tests. Never construct domain objects or database records inline in test bodies. Factories centralise the knowledge of how to build valid objects and make tests resilient to schema changes.
- Test behaviour, not implementation. A test should survive a refactor of the internals as long as the external behaviour is unchanged.
- One concept per test. Multiple assertions are fine if they all verify the same logical outcome. Testing multiple independent behaviours in one test makes failures ambiguous.
- Tests must be hermetic. A test must not depend on the order it runs in, on shared mutable state, or on the side effects of another test.
- Avoid logic in tests. No conditionals, no loops, no try/catch. If you need logic to construct the expected value, that is a sign the test is too complex.
- Name the thing under test, the scenario, and the expected outcome: `calculateDiscount_whenUserIsVIP_returns20Percent`.

## TypeScript / JavaScript

**Framework**: Use Vitest for unit and integration tests. Use Playwright for end-to-end.

### Factories

Every domain object (User, Order, Product, etc.) has a corresponding factory class. Factories live in tests/factories/ and are the only place in the test suite that knows how to construct a valid instance of a domain object.

**BaseFactory** — define this once in `test_utils/factories/base.ts` and extend it for every domain type:

```ts
export abstract class BaseFactory {
  abstract build(overrides?: Partial): T

  buildList(count: number, overrides?: Partial): T[] {
    return Array.from({ length: count }, () => this.build(overrides))
  }
}
```

**Domain factory** — one file per domain type in `test_utils/factories/`:

```ts
import { randomUUID } from 'crypto'
import { BaseFactory } from './base'
import type { User } from '../../src/types'

const TEST_PASSWORD_HASH = '$2b$10$test-hash-for-testing-only'

class UserFactory extends BaseFactory {
  build(overrides: Partial = {}): User {
    return {
      id: randomUUID(),
      name: 'Test User',
      email: `test-${randomUUID()}@example.com`,
      passwordHash: TEST_PASSWORD_HASH,
      isAdmin: false,
      companyId: null,
      createdAt: new Date(),
      updatedAt: new Date(),
      ...overrides,
    }
  }
}

export const userFactory = new UserFactory()
```

**Usage in tests** — always use the factory, never inline objects:

```ts
// Good
const user = userFactory.build()
const admin = userFactory.build({ isAdmin: true })
const users = userFactory.buildList(3)

// Bad — never do this
const user = { id: '123', name: 'Test User', email: 'test@example.com', ... }
```

**Key rules for factories:**

- Default values must produce a valid, fully-configured object with no required fields missing.
- Use `randomUUID()` for IDs and unique fields (like email) so tests are hermetic by default — two calls to `build()` produce independent objects.
- Use a fixed constant for values that are expensive to compute or must be consistent across tests (like `TEST_PASSWORD_HASH`).
- Overrides use the spread-last pattern: define all defaults first, then spread `overrides` at the end. This ensures any override wins cleanly.
- Do not put logic or conditionals inside `build()`. If you need a meaningfully different variant, create a named helper method on the factory:

```ts
class UserFactory extends BaseFactory {
  build(overrides: Partial = {}): User { ... }

  admin(overrides: Partial = {}): User {
    return this.build({ isAdmin: true, ...overrides })
  }

  withCompany(companyId: string, overrides: Partial = {}): User {
    return this.build({ companyId, ...overrides })
  }
}
```

**Mocking**: Use `vi.mock` at module boundaries only — external services, database clients, filesystem. Do not mock functions within the same module you are testing. Prefer dependency injection over module-level mocking where possible.

**Async**: Always `await` async calls in tests. Never use `done` callbacks. Prefer `async/await` over `.resolves`/`.rejects` matchers for readability, except when the assertion is the only thing in the test.

**React component tests**: Use React Testing Library. Query by accessible role, label, or visible text. Do not use `getByTestId` or `getByRole` with fabricated roles. Do not test internal state or component methods. Test what a user would see and interact with.

```ts
// Good
expect(screen.getByRole('button', { name: 'Submit' })).toBeDisabled()

// Bad
expect(wrapper.instance().state.isLoading).toBe(true)
```

**Coverage**: Do not chase coverage numbers. 100% coverage with behaviour-free tests is worthless. Aim for tests that would catch real regressions.

## Python

**Framework**: Use `pytest`. Use `pytest-factoryboy` with `factory_boy` for factories, or plain fixture functions returning dataclass/Pydantic instances.

**Factories**: Define factories in a `factories.py` file per module or in a shared `tests/factories/` directory. Register them as pytest fixtures where appropriate.

```python
import factory

class UserFactory(factory.Factory):
    class Meta:
        model = User

    id = factory.Sequence(lambda n: f"user-{n}")
    email = factory.LazyAttribute(lambda o: f"{o.id}@example.com")
    role = "member"
```

**Fixtures**: Use `pytest` fixtures for setup and teardown. Keep fixtures small and composable. Avoid giant `conftest.py` files that do everything — split by concern.

**Mocking**: Use `pytest-mock` (`mocker` fixture) or `unittest.mock.patch` as a context manager. Patch at the point of use, not at the point of definition.

```python
# Good — patch where it is used
def test_sends_email(mocker):
    send = mocker.patch("myapp.notifications.send_email")
    trigger_notification()
    send.assert_called_once()
```

**Async**: Use `pytest-asyncio` for async tests. Mark async tests with `@pytest.mark.asyncio`.

**Parametrize**: Use `@pytest.mark.parametrize` to cover multiple input cases without duplicating test bodies. Each parameter set should have an `id` for readable failure output.
